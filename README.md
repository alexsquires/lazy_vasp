# lazy_vasp (WIP)
Scripts for things people better at this than me haven't made/already have a better way of doing that I didn't think of. 

## Python

- SC-Fermi interface, to generate input files for https://github.com/jbuckeridge/sc-fermi currently very, very hands on and hacky and needs serious generalisation

- CPLAPer! (or, Python CPLAP wrapper) automated generation of inputs for https://sourceforge.net/projects/cplap/files/ much closer to being sucessfully generalised, although currently just a list of python functions to be worked into a command line program. It also currently only works with quaternary materials systems. Updates to rapidly follow.


 ## Shell Scripts

cpcalc.sh
when.sh  


### DEPRECATED

supercell.py
 -takes a poscar and multiplies it in three dimensions to return desired supercell (written with charged defect calculations in mind)
