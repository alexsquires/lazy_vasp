# lazy_vasp (WIP)
Scripts for things people better at this than me haven't made/already have a better way of doing that I didn't think of. 

## Python


supercell.py
 -takes a poscar and multiplies it in three dimensions to return desired supercell (written with charged defect calculations in mind) 

 ## Shell Scripts

cpcalc.sh
when.sh
